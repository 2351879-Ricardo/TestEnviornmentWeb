    <h1>What Interactivity Means On The WWW</h1>
    <h2>The Development of the Web</h2>
    <p>
      With Web development, from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, interactivity became a huge
      factor in developing, considering, and using web design. This development
      was the first transition from static, read-only websites, to a more
      dynamic, user-varied, read-write form of providing and receiving
      information. However, it did not stop there. Web 3.0 is the idea of having
      the web analyzed according to user data. Content searched, links clicked,
      and the navigation between different places on the web is used to directly
      affect how information is provided to the user on the internet. In the
      rawest and basic form, this can be seen on websites such as YouTube,
      Twitch, and most social media platforms in which the SEO is used to gather
      information (on common topics, people, etc.) which is run through an
      algorithm that filters through content to give out recommended content
      that the user may enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it may not seem very interactable on the surface, the entire search
      algorithm and the filtering of content are based on our preferences,
      likes, and commonly searched topics. This itself is a form of input that
      is reliant on the user and is not completely the same for one person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of Web 3.0, also brings along the ethical problems such as
      gathering user information that may be considered private and having it
      used for commercial uses. This problem has already arisen multiple times
      in the past, as seen with many scandals from Facebook regarding user
      information.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Is Interactivity Important for the WWW?</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the main focus of interactivity is receiving an input
      from a user and displaying an output that is customized in a way such that
      it is preferable for said user. With the advancements in technology and
      how we receive, perceive, and share information across the web, the amount
      of information found and stored on the web is constantly increasing at a
      drastic speed. As such, one cannot be expected to read and have to filter
      through all this information, as nothing would actually be done. As such,
      user input is essential in minimizing the need to find valid sources and
      information that the user is interested in. This is the core principle for
      interactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web is constantly evolving in such a way to make life easier for the
      consumer by providing recommendations on the user's taste, and as such
      websites aim to make their websites interactive, not only for displaying
      products, but also to provide a quick and easy experience for the user -
      an essential thing to have in a fast moving environment (as people will
      tend to click off and find another site if the current website is too
      jarring).
