    <h1>What Is A Browser</h1>
    <p>
      Simply put, a browser is a piece of software. This software is used as a
      medium for displaying information from the web. There are many different
      browsers, each offering slight differences and quirks, but at the end of
      the day, they all do the same thing - display information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Web Browser is responsible for taking in user input (for what the user
      is looking for) and displaying information regarding said input. The
      information displayed is dependent on the URL, which is a unique
      identifier for a webpage. This URL is used as a reference to know where to
      pull data from and what to display. Through the use of web-programming
      languages, the browser then displays the information requested by the
      code, loading in details such as text, images and possibly other
      hyperlinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the most basic and unexplained terms, it is a form of software that is
      responsible for gathering information from other parts of the web and
      displaying it a way such that it is consumable by the user.
