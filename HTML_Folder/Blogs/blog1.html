    <h1>What Is HyperText?</h1>
    <p>
      In this reading, the writer explores, both conceptually and literally, the
      meaning of hypertext. Throughout the reading the writer expresses multiple
      varying definitions to already existing defined terms for hypertext. It
      also here that he mentions hypertext as something that is built upon the
      understanding of its history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the questions of “What is communism”, “What is natural selection” and
      many more of such thought, definitions seem to vary according to who you
      ask. When approaching this thought, my mind wanders to that of the
      question, “What is a game?”, a question often discussed, debated, and
      differently defined within the Game Design community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, I believe (that much like the definition of a “game”), the
      definition is something that is relative to the speaker, the interpreter,
      and the context of the situation in which it is being used. An example
      would be request of a hyperlink for a website, in which the literal text
      is requested. This varies to the definition of a hyperlink regarding the
      media and the entire concept behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than defining hypertext as one definition, I feel it is important
      to rather explore the multiple variations in the definition, as possibly
      create multiple definitions (based on context). Like words in the English
      language, words can have multiple meanings, only really being able to be
      fully understood when used in a sentence that provides context.

      Later in the text, a definition for hypermedia is quoted from Nelson. Here
      it is described as a branching form of presenting media to the user in a
      way that is controlled by the user’s actions (with hypertext being a
      subclass of hypermedia). Described as media, Nelson tries to remove the
      thought of hypermedia being a static form of information, but rather an
      interactive form of information that is designed, like that of other
      media.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also mentioned in the reading that much like previously coined
      terms, such as "communism" and the like, the definition and idea was based
      on a certain way of thinking of a particular person. This further cements
      my point of it being relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using communism as an example, people often define communism in two ways:
      the way in which communism is currently implemented in the world, or
      rather the ideal, predefined concept of what communism should be. Both of
      these have large variations in the definition as the concept of
      "communism" has been skewed from the actual definition itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I don’t feel and believe that hypertext should be defined by a
      single term, but rather be seen as a form of media, varying with different
      interpretations and definitions, based on the users view of it.
